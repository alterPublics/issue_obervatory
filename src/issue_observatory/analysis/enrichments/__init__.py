"""Pluggable content enrichment pipeline.

Owned by the Core Application Engineer.

Enrichers are post-collection processors that add derived data to content
records without requiring schema migrations.  Each enricher writes its
output into ``raw_metadata.enrichments.{enricher_name}`` as a JSONB
sub-object.

Available enrichers:
- :class:`LanguageDetector` — detects language for any target language using
  langdetect, with a configurable expected-language list that tags results as
  ``expected`` or not.  Accepts optional ``expected_languages`` (ISO 639-1
  list) at construction.
- :class:`NamedEntityExtractor` — extracts named entities and classifies
  actor roles in text (stub; full NER requires the ``nlp-ner`` extra).
- :class:`PropagationEnricher` — GR-08: computes cross-arena temporal
  propagation sequences for near-duplicate clusters, identifying which arena
  published content first and how it spread over time.
- :class:`CoordinationDetector` — GR-11: detects potential coordinated
  inauthentic behaviour (CIB) by flagging near-duplicate clusters where
  multiple distinct authors post near-identical content within a narrow
  time window.
- :class:`SentimentAnalyzer` — IP2-034: computes Danish sentiment scores
  using the AFINN lexicon (requires the ``nlp`` extra).
- :class:`UrlExtractor` — extracts, cleans, and catalogs URLs from content
  records; writes to both JSONB and the ``extracted_urls`` relational table.
- :class:`EngagementScorer` — data-driven per-platform engagement
  normalization using fitted Yeo-Johnson + MinMaxScaler transformers.
